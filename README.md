# AI-Based-Network-Attack-Classification

This project focused on developing an AI-powered system to classify network attack types using machine learning techniques. Traditional rule-based security systems struggle to detect novel cyber threats, requiring frequent manual updates. To address this, we built a model capable of identifying various attack patterns dynamically.
